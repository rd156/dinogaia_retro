    "CONTENT_0": "The awakening is confusing. An unknown jungle, a heavy and oppressive silence. There are no landmarks, no familiarity. Then the anomalies appear: human ruins, creatures that should never have coexisted, smells that don't match anything known. Everything seems... wrong. The air is thick, saturated with humidity and strange aromas that mix in a disturbing way. The jungle is alive with familiar sounds... but something is off. The echo of crushed leaves seems too distant, and the wind carries scents that shouldn't be together. Instinct guides the first steps, but the landmarks have vanished. Where familiar trees once stood, plants with unexpected shapes wrap their vines around massive trunks, releasing unknown fragrances. The ground is scattered with footprints, but they belong to creatures from another age. Imposing traces, with oversized claws, mix with those of unknown animals. No sign of familiar life. This is not a known territory. Instinct screams: this world is broken."
